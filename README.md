A web-browser-based multidimensional 3D visualizer for confocal and focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy modalities.
Four visualization modules are available: Volume, Surface, Tri-Planar, and Multi-planar reconstruction.
Our visualizer takes a sequence of images or stacked image files as input and displays them based on the preferences of the user viewer.
For now our visualizer intakes: .dcm, .tif, .tiff, .bmp, .jpg, .mha, .mrc, .nii, .png, .nrrd, .mgh image files as an input.

## Features:
- Volume Rendering (Opacity value slider, Sample distance slider, Blending mode choice, Color choice, Region of intrest clipping slider, Z-dimension scaling)
- Surface Rendering (Opacity value slider, Iso value slider, Color choice, Region of interest clipping slider, Z-dimension scaling)
- Tri-Planar Rendering ((XY, YZ, XZ) slider, Color window and level manipulator, Mouse selector (rotate, pan, zoom options))
- Multi-Planar Reconstruction (Orthoviewer, Separate window for each plane with 3D Image Slice mapper)
